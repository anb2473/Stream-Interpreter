##   Supported Versions

Software versions currently being maintained for security issues:

|   Version       |   Supported   |
|   -------       |   ------------------   |
|   Pre 4.2.0     |   :x:                  |
|   4.2.0         |   :white_check_mark:   |

**Note:** We plan to consistently address security concerns in certain legacy models, so deprecated legacy features should not pose a significant security risk. If you wish to request support for a legacy version or report an issue on an unsupported version, please feel free to open a new issue in the repository's "Issues" section.
